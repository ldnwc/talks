### Past and future talks from the London Web Components meetup

This repository holds a record of all the past and future speakers who so kindly volunteered, or are planning to volunteer, their knowledge and wisdom at a London Web Components event!

You can look at this as a sort of archive and calendar, we'll be using it as our primary space to organise future talks, so subscribe to updates if you're interested in following what will be coming up in the near future.
